# Refactoring YangParseTreePaths

## Background

The developers who implemented OpenConfig/gNMI support for DPDK in
P4-OVS made extensive changes to the implementation of the
*YangParseTreePaths* class (yang\_parse\_tree\_paths.cc).

- Many of the paths were changed from */interfaces/interface* to
  */interfaces/virtual-interface*.
- Several *state* nodes were changed to *config* nodes.
- A number of new port attributes (leaves) were added.

In the process, roughly 1500 lines of code were added to the file.
Further changes are planned.

## Problem statement

- yang\_parse\_tree\_paths is a common file. We cannot make arbitrary
  changes to it without affecting other targets, especially not changes
  that alter existing paths.
- The unmodified file has \~4100 lines of code, which is unwieldy.
  The modified file has \~5600 lines, which is unmanageable.
- We expect to be making additional changes in the future.

## Proposed solution

Refactor *yang\_parse\_tree\_paths.cc* into a number of smaller files,
each preferably having no more than 1000 lines of source code.

Maintain the order of the functions in each file.

- This will allow the original file to be diffed with each of the
  derivative files to verify the integrity of the refactoring.

Ensure that the *AddSubtreeInterface*Â method and its supporting
functions are separated from the rest of the code.

- This will allow us to replace *AddSubtreeInterface* and add new
  supporting functions by selecting a different set of files in
  the DPDK build.
- The DPDK-specific files will be in *stratum/hal/lib/tdi/dpdk*.

Move the YANG files to a new *stratum/hal/lib/yang* directory (paralleling
*stratum/hal/lib/p4*).

- This avoids cluttering the *common* directory, which already has \~50
  non-YANG files in it.

## 4. Outcome

The result of the refactoring is as follows:

## Further changes

### DPDK support

For DPDK, we have added the following to *stratum/hal/lib/tdi/dpdk*:

- dpdk_add_subtree_interface.cc
- dpdk_parse_tree_interface.cc
- dpdk_parse_tree_interface.h

### Unit tests

It might be worth looking into refactoring *yang\_parse\_tree\_test.cc*.

- At \~5600 lines, its size is excessive for a manually maintained file.
- We should also (cough) provide test cases for the new functionality.

## Alternatives

We could limit the refactoring to *AddSubtreeInterface* and its
support functions.

This would reduce the impact on the existing code, but it would do
nothing for the maintainability of *yang\_parse\_tree\_paths.cc*.

We would still need to create the following files in order to support DPDK:

- yang_add_subtree_interface.cc
- yang_parse_tree_helpers.cc
- yang_parse_tree_helpers.h
- yang_parse_tree_interface.cc
- yang_parse_tree_interface.h
